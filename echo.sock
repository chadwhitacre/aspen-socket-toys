# Aspen represents all HTTP resources as files on your filesystem. Socket
# resources are any files named *.sock. They are Python files that are exec'd
# continously while a socket is open. Inside of a socket resource you have a
# socket object with send and recv methods that enables you to communicate with
# each connected client.

socket.send(socket.recv())
